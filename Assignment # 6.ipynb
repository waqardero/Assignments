    "Question 1:\n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "Answer: one of the most popular approach to solve a programming problem is by creating objects\n",
    "this is known as Object Oriented Programming.\n",
    "An object has two characteristics.\n",
    "attributes means variables.\n",
    "and behaviour means methods.(Block of reuseable code)\n",
    "\n",
    "In every Programming language OOP Concept runs on same principales.\n",
    "1: Inhertence => A process of using details from a new class without modifying existing class.\n",
    "2: Encapsulation => Hiding the private details of a class from other objects.\n",
    "3: Polymorphism => A concept of using common  operations in different ways for differnt data input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2:\n",
    "List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "Answer  :\n",
    "The basic concept is that instead of writing a program, you create a class, which is a kind of template containing variables \n",
    "and functions. Objects are self-contained instances of that class, and you can get them to interact in fun and exciting ways.\n",
    "Inheritance is a way of creating new class for using details of existing class without modifying it. The newly formed class is\n",
    "a derived class (or child class). Similarly, the existing class is a base class (or parent class).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OOP in Python, we can restrict access to methods and variables. This prevent data from direct modification which is\n",
    "called encapsulation.In Python, we denote private attribute using underscore as prefix i.e single “ _ “ or double “ __“.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use common interface for multiple form (data types).\n",
    "in OOP programm is very efficient and readable . we code thousands of thousands of line but it is not loaded in memory until we want to \n",
    "use the code and only that peice of code is used which we had required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3:\n",
    "Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "Answer  :\n",
    "Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its name only, we need\n",
    "to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they\n",
    "are dependent on that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4:\n",
    "Define the following terms:\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. \n",
    "In python a class is created by the keyword class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "Attribute is like members of class means variables etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    "Behavior is methods that what they should do. what functionality performed by them.\n",
    "\n",
